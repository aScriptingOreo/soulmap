## WE NEED HELP!
Avakot needs players that are willing to help with data gathering inside the game, with P9 the game got REALLY huge! We need all the help we can get to grow the data inside the map, if you feel like you can help, just pop up in our discord and let a Developer know!

### Speaking of help
None of this would've been possible without @Remico, our main contributor for the P9 updates, all the new main locations and world trees were catalogued by her!

# Changelog 
- You can now input coordinates [X,Y] directly into the search bar and it will tell you what's there
- Re-done precision on some markers
- Added Enclave markers
- Added persistant toggle for icons(You can now toggle things and they will stay hidden after a refresh)
- Better display for clicked markers
- You can now share the url to a specific marker or location
- New marker for on-click on random coordinates, so it's easier to share screenshots.
- Removed 'Drops' system from soulmap entirely, there is a lovely community tool called Soulframe Plus that is handling item tracking and acquisition, check them out!
