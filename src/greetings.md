## WE NEED HELP!
Avakot needs players that are willing to help with data gathering inside the game, with P9 the game got REALLY huge! We need all the help we can get to grow the data inside the map, if you feel like you can help, just pop up in our discord and let a Developer know!

### Speaking of help
None of this would've been possible without @Remico, our main contributor for the P9 updates, all the new main locations and world trees were catalogued by her!

# Changelog 
1.0.1
- Patch 1.0.1 is here and it's pretty cool
- We can now update the map live, without you having to press F5
- Pressing Ctrl + F5 will force reload the markers(Ctrl + R also works)
