lore: "A lonely watchtower, overlooking the clear waters of the Salz. When the Princess of Kaxia was exiled to Midrath in the early 300s, she took residence in Creedance High and refused to leave. Some say she did it out of scorn; others say it was for love of a lowly fisherman she watched from the roof."
