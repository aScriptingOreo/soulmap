lore: "During the Cassid reign over Midrath, the ruling General, Napo Agnes, found a fascination in the night sky. In his own words, Midrathian nights, unlike Cassid nights, are not “tainted by the ever-glow of the Borealis.” Thus he converted many Dendrit towers, such as this, into astrologists’ chambers, filling them with experts from across the many Isles."
