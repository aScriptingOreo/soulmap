lore: "Mirifuir has stood upon the cliff’s edge for a thousand years. No rise nor fall of Kingdoms, no coming or going of Ode, not even the ever-pounding of the waves could topple it. For its walls were blessed by the Fey Empress in a rare meeting ‘twixt her court and the Midrathian Queen, Finngualla."
