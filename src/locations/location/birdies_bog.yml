lore: "A pocket of Aurel on the Isle of Midrath. ‘Tis said that the Grimpante Trees of Birdie’s Bog are not native to the Isle, but a gift from the Aureli Queen Bernadette. Legend has it, she dropped a single seed in a bottle and cast it afloat upon the ocean Salz. By Iridis’ guidance, it beached on Midrath the next morning."
