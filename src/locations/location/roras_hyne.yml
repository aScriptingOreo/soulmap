lore: "First the home of a hermit noble, then the study of the occupier’s astrologists. Rora’s Hyne has lived many lives. Most recently, this old tower housed a library of Feybles. After the Felling, it was the last place on Midrath where one could read freely the word of the Fey. Until of course, the Ode arrived and burned it all away."
